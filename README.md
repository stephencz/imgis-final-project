# imgis-final-project
Python scripts I built to gather data for my final map for my Intro to Mapping and Geographic Information Systems course.
Writing scripts to collect data wasn't a requirement, it was just something I did because I couldn't find the data I needed anywhere else.

These scripts aren't maintained, and the data is updated, so chances are they are now defunct.
When they did work they scraped addresses from various supermarket chains in NJ and got their latitude and longitude.
This data was then used to create point data to display on a map made in ArcGIS.
